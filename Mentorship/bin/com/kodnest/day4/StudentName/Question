You have been appointed as an intern at a local school in your town. 
The school has decided to digitize the process of students' entry into 
various extracurricular activities. They want to have a computer-based 
solution that would help them keep better track of who is taking up these activities.

For the initial phase, they have assigned you the task to make a 
Java application that can take a student's name as input (a single word) 
and prints it out. Please note that in this rudimentary version, they want 
to accept only a single word as the student's name to keep things simple and fast-paced.

Examples:

Input:

Enter the student's name: Tom

Output:

The student's name is: Tom

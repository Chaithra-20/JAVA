Imagine you and your friend want to exchange your phone numbers. 
But instead of simply telling each other the numbers, 
you decide to do it in a more complex way for fun. 
Write a Java method called swapTwoNumbers which takes two 
integers as parameters (representing your and your friend's phone numbers), 
and swaps the values of the two numbers without using a third variable. 
The method should then print the numbers.

Examples:

Input:

1234567890, 9876543210

Output:

9876543210, 1234567890

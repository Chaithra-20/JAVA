Consider yourself as a software developer in a company that produces horoscope analysis 
applications. The company wants to develop a personalized horoscope
feature that requires the user's birth date and Zodiac sign. 
The birth date will be used for age calculations and the Zodiac sign will 
be applied for horoscope-related assessments. With this objective, 
your task is to write a Java program that reads the user's day and 
month of birth as integers and their Zodiac sign as a String. 
After the user provides this information, the program should print these 
details on separate lines.

Remember, incorrect data can misguide the user in terms of their horoscope 
readings and might lead to loss of their trust in the application.

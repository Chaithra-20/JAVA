Java language offers two types of casting: implicit
(widening) and explicit (narrowing). 
Implicit type casting is crucial in scenarios when
we are dealing with types of different sizes. 
For example, consider a real-world situation where
a small Internet of Things (IoT) device is sending
data in compact and efficient byte format. 
This data, when processed by high-capacity 
software systems built to handle larger data types,
might need an on-the-fly adjustment for successful 
processing. For this task, you need to demonstrate 
the concept of implicit type casting in Java programming. 
Initialize a byte variable with a value of 10, 
implicitly cast it to short, int, and long data types, and then print their values.

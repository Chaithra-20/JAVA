Question Description:

You are building a weather advisory system for a travel application. 
Write a Java program that provides travel advice based on the weather conditions.

The program should take two inputs: temperature 
(an integer representing the temperature in degrees Celsius) and isRaining 
(a boolean indicating whether it's raining or not).

The advisory system is defined as follows:

路 If the temperature is below 10 degrees Celsius, it's advised to bring a coat.

路 If the temperature is between 10 and 20 degrees Celsius (inclusive) and it's raining, 
it's advised to bring an umbrella.

路 If the temperature is between 10 and 20 degrees Celsius (inclusive) and it's not raining, 
no special advice is needed.

路 If the temperature is above 20 degrees Celsius, it's advised to wear light clothing.

Problem 3: Triangle Type Determination

Question Title: Triangle Type Determination

Question Description:

You are working on a geometry application, and you need to determine the type of 
triangle based on its sides. Write a Java program that takes three inputs: 
side1, side2, and side3 (all integers representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle).

The program should determine and output whether the triangle is:

· Equilateral (all sides are of equal length)

· Isosceles (exactly two sides are of equal length)

· Scalene (no sides are of equal length)

Write a Java program that accomplishes this.

Sample Input 1:

3 4 5

Sample Output 1:

Scalene

Sample Input 2:

5 5 8

Sample Output 2:

Isosceles

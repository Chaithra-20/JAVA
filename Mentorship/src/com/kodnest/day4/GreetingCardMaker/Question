You are developing a greeting card application. The application should have a 
feature to generate a greeting message by taking two inputs: the greeting and 
the name of the recipient. Write a Java program that declares a method printGreeting(). 
This method should take two string parameters: greeting and name. When called, it 
should print the greeting and the name.

Examples:

Input:

Hello

John

Output:

"Hello, John"

Input:

"Bye", "Rohit"

Output:

"Bye, Rohit"

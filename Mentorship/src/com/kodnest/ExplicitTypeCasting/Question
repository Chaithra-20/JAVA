Consider a situation where you're working on a digital processing application 
which transmits ASCII values across another conventional system that only handles 
character data. You would ultimately convert integer ASCII values into their respective 
characters. Therefore, write a Java program to demonstrate explicit casting from int to char. 
Declare an int variable and assign the ASCII value 65, then explicitly cast it to a char, 
finally, print its value.
